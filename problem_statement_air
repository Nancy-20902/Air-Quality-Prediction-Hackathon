# Air Quality Prediction Hackathon

## 🎯 Task
Predict the AirQuality index (1 to 5) using weather + pollution sensor data.

- This is a **multiclass classification** problem.
- Target variable: `AirQuality` (values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

---

## 🗂 Dataset Files

You are provided with:

1. `train.csv`
2. `test.csv` (target removed)
3. `sample_submission.csv`

## 🧪 train.csv
Contains **80% earliest chronological data**.

Includes all columns:

- Weather features (Temp, Humidity, etc.)
- Pollution features (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, etc.)
- Cyclical time features (SineDay, CosineDay, etc.)
- Target: **AirQuality** (1 to 5)

## 🔍 test.csv
Contains **20% most recent timestamps**.

Same features as train **except `AirQuality` is removed**.

Your job:  
Predict the `AirQuality` for each row.

## 📤 sample_submission.csv

Format:

UtcTime | AirQuality  
---|-------------  
integer row index | predicted value (1–5)

You must submit a file in this exact format.

## 🏆 Evaluation Metric

## ⚠ Important Notes

- The split is **time-based**, so there is **no data leakage**.
- You may use ML models or deep learning.
- You must submit predictions for **every row in test.csv**.

# ✅ Column-by-Column Explanation

## 🕒 Time Features

These create cyclical representations of time so ML models can learn periodic patterns.

- 1. UtcTime

Unix timestamp

- 2. LocalDate

Human-readable date for Kiev (YYYY-MM-DD).

- 3. LocalHour

Hour of day (0–23) in local time.

# ✅ ⏳ Cyclical Time Encodings

These are sine/cosine transforms so ML can understand cyclic behavior (day, week, month, year).

Why?
Because hour 23 and hour 0 are far apart numerically, but adjacent cyclically.

- 4–5. SineDay, CosineDay

Encode hour of day (0–23) on a circle.

Helps model daily temperature/pollution cycles.

- 6–7. SineWeek, CosineWeek

Day of the week (Mon…Sun) encoded cyclically.

- 8–9. SineMonth, CosineMonth

Month of year encoded cyclically (Jan → Dec).

- 10–11. SineYear, CosineYear

Encodes long-term yearly seasonality.

# 🌡 Weather Features

Direct meteorological measurements.

- 12. Temperature

Temperature (°C).

- 13. DewPoint

Temperature at which condensation starts.

Indicates moisture/humidity.

- 14. Pressure

Atmospheric pressure (hPa).

- 15. Humidity

Relative humidity (%) — moisture in air.

- 16. WindSpeed

Wind speed (m/s).

- 17–18. WindSine, WindCosine

Wind direction encoded cyclically.

Derived from wind angle.

- 19. WindAngle

Wind direction in degrees (0–360°).

- 20. CloudLevel

Cloud cover percentage (0–100).

- 21. WeatherType

Text label such as:

Clouds

Rain

Clear

Snow, etc.

# Air Pollution Features

These are concentrations of pollution gases and particles.

- 22. LevelCO

Carbon monoxide (µg/m³).

- 23. LevelNO

Nitric oxide (NO) — traffic and industrial emissions.

- 24. LevelNO2

Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) — harmful pollutant.

- 25. LevelO3

Ozone (O₃) — ground-level ozone (harmful).

- 26. LevelSO2

Sulfur dioxide (SO₂) — industrial pollutant.

- 27. LevelNH3

Ammonia (NH₃) — agriculture/industry emissions.

- 28. LevelPM2

Particulate Matter < 2.5 microns (PM2.5).

Very harmful small particles.

- 29. LevelPM10

Particulate Matter < 10 microns (PM10).

# 🟩 Target Variable
- 30. AirQuality

Integer class label representing AQI category.
